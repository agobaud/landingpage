				<h3>02.Design Guidelines</h3>
				<h4>Context based space and surface</h4>
					<p>We wanted a system that would able to work on any surface in the house, and would recognize the surface that it was on, and adjust accordingly.</p>
				<h4>Mobility and portability</h4>
					<p>The system needed to be easily accessed anywhere in the house, and allow for the user to work with it outside of the house as well.</p>
				<h4>User-based personalization</h4>
					<p>Because university students usually live with multiple people in one house/apartment, it is important for the system to recognize the different users and adapt to each of their needs.</p>
				<h4>Keep most of responsibility on user</h4>
					<p>University students rarely live in the same place for more than a couple of years. We did not want users to become reliant on the system so much that they would forget basic aspects of responsibility. Eventually, they will move into a different house, and we wanted to make sure that they'd still be able to live in a non-smart house.</p>
				<h4>Tolerance for routine and changes in routine</h4>
				<p>Many parts of a student's lifestyle are routine, but there are many non-routine tasks that they take part in. The system needs to be able to recognize routine and adapt, so that they system does not become cumbersome to deal with.</p>
