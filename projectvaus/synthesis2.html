				<p> The above infographic is the result observing the setting and mindset of the interviewee as he or she recalled past stressful events related to taking care of the house. From the interviews it was apparent that not only were there commonalities in the sources of stress among students we interviewed(see <a href="synthesis.html">Sources of Stress</a>), but also commonalities in the situations that preceed these stressful situations. We found that most interviewees, when encountering the <a href="synthesis.html">these stressful situations</a>, were often preoccupied with tasks that we have divided into two categories in the above infographic: time-sensitive and life-essential. Tasks that fell into these categories tended to be the highest priority. In most cases, due to the students preoccupation with these higher priority tasks, tasks that are neither time-sensitive or life-essential tended to be repeatedly neglected. As a result, the consequences of neglecting the task would often grow larger as time goes on.</p>
				<h4>Conclusion from findings</h4>
				<p> From the interviews, it was apparent that tasks related to maintaining the house often fit into this category of neglected tasks. An example of this is neglecting to turn off a flat iron. The consequences at first are negligible, but as time goes on, the risk of it being a fire hazard, and the increased amount of energy wasted, increases the possibility of stress to the student in the future. To address these type of situations, the team decided to design a system that would assist users in completing these tasks in a timely manner to minimize stress, without taking responsibility away from the user. </p>
