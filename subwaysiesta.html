				<em>Develop an application for mobile workers who use mass transit to commute to multiple job sites.</em>
				<p>We spent time thinking about different problems New Yorkers face with their daily commute on the  subway, and thought about the different ways New Yorkers like to spend their time during their routine commutes. We realized that commuters try to spend their time in the subway as efficnetly as possible, by reading, listening to music, sleeping, etc. Very rarely do we see New Yorkers doing nothing on long subway rides.</p>
		
				<p>This led to the birth of Subway Siesta. We know that people riding public transportation in New York City need to pay attention to upcoming stops so they do not miss their destination. Frequent users of public transportation would like to use their travel time productively - Subway Siesta allows users to do just that.</p>

		<div class="project-content">In any city, mobile workers waste a lot of time while riding public transportation between work sites and clients. They try to use their time wisely, but having to pay attention to the upcoming transfers and such, this time is never truly used productively.</div>
		<div class="project-content">Here comes SubwaySiesta - an iPhone application which allows users to use a timer to countdown the amount of time left to their next stop. This allows the mobile workers to focus more on whatever they want during their travel time and be alerted when their stop is approaching. This will help to make better use of commuters' time, and ensure that our traveling workers get where they need to be on time.</div>
		<div class="project-content">SubwaySiesta also takes care of the basics in that it acts as a New York City public transit map, and provides a transit schedule relative to the current time to help keep the mobile workers on time.</div>
		<div class="project-content">Knowing this, we came up with our hunt statement for the project:</div>
		<div class="project-content"><em>People who ride public transportation in New York City need to pay attention to upcoming stops so that they do not miss their destination. Frequent users of public transportation would like to use their travel time productively.</em></div>
		<div class="project-images"><img src="img/subwaysiesta1.png"></div>
		<div class="project-content">We began to storyboard how users would complete essential tasks in our mobile app. Here, we show how a user would select the tranfers they choose to take.</div>
		<div class="project-images"><img src="img/subwaysiesta2.png" ></div>
		<div class="project-content">We then went on to create basic wireframes to show what the app would look like while the user was in the middle of their journey.</div>
		<div class="project-content">This project also had us focus on creating a solid persona to work with during our design process. Meet Rachel Wells, our 27 year old designer living in New York City. She lives in Lower Manhattan and travels frequently to client locations for site visits. She spends much of her days on the subway, and wants a way to be more productive about her subway rides.</div>
